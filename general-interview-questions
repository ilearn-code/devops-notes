# General DevOps Questions

## 1. What is DevOps, and how is it different from Agile?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and ensure continuous delivery. It emphasizes automation, monitoring, and collaboration.

**Difference from Agile:**
- Agile focuses on iterative software development.
- DevOps focuses on automating the release and deployment process.

## 2. What are the key benefits of DevOps?
- Faster delivery of software updates
- Improved collaboration between teams
- Reduced failures and quick recovery
- Higher automation, reducing manual work
- Better scalability and reliability

## 3. What are the main phases of a DevOps lifecycle?
1. **Plan** – Define project goals  
2. **Develop** – Write and manage code  
3. **Build** – Compile and package code  
4. **Test** – Automated testing  
5. **Release** – Versioning and deployment  
6. **Deploy** – Move to production  
7. **Operate** – Monitor and maintain  
8. **Monitor** – Collect logs and metrics  

## 4. Explain Infrastructure as Code (IaC). How does it benefit DevOps?
IaC means managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.  
**Benefits:**
- Consistency
- Automation
- Version control
- Faster provisioning

## 5. What are CI, CD, and Continuous Deployment?
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates code integration and testing.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Ensures code is always in a deployable state.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automates deployment to production without manual approval.

# Version Control & Git

## 6. What is Git, and how does it help in DevOps?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps in tracking changes in code. It enables collaboration and integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

## 7. What is the difference between Git Merge and Git Rebase?
- **Merge:** Creates a new commit combining changes.
- **Rebase:** Moves commits from one branch to another, keeping a linear history.

## 8. How do you resolve a Git merge conflict?
1. Run `git status` to check conflicting files.  
2. Edit files manually to resolve conflicts.  
3. Use `git add` to stage resolved files.  
4. Commit the changes using `git commit`.

## 9. What is Gitflow, and when should it be used?
Gitflow is a branching model that uses develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches. It’s used in large teams for structured development.

## 10. How do you squash commits in Git?
Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n` (replace `n` with the number of commits).  
Mark the commits you want to squash as `squash`.

# CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)

## 11. What is the role of Jenkins in a DevOps pipeline?
Jenkins automates building, testing, and deployment of applications.

## 12. How does a CI/CD pipeline work?
1. Developers push code  
2. CI runs tests  
3. Code is built  
4. Deployment (CD) happens automatically or manually  

## 13. What are some best practices for writing Jenkins pipelines?
- Use declarative pipelines.
- Keep pipeline scripts in version control.
- Use credentials securely.

## 14. What is the difference between declarative and scripted pipelines in Jenkins?
- **Declarative:** Uses a simple syntax (`Jenkinsfile`).
- **Scripted:** Uses Groovy scripting for complex workflows.

## 15. How do you implement rollback strategies in CI/CD?
- **Blue-Green Deployments:** Keep the previous version running.
- **Canary Releases:** Deploy to a small subset first.
- **Revert in Version Control:** Use Git to roll back.

# Configuration Management (Ansible, Chef, Puppet)

## 16. What is Configuration Management, and why is it important in DevOps?
Configuration Management ensures consistent and automated infrastructure configuration, reducing human errors.

## 17. How does Ansible differ from Chef and Puppet?
- **Ansible:** Agentless, YAML-based, easy to use.
- **Chef/Puppet:** Agent-based, more complex but powerful.

## 18. What are Ansible playbooks, and how do they work?
Playbooks are YAML files that define automation tasks.

## 19. How do you manage sensitive data in Ansible?
Use **Ansible Vault** to encrypt sensitive files.

## 20. Explain idempotency in configuration management.
Running the same script multiple times doesn’t change the system beyond its intended state.

# Containerization & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)

## 21. What are the benefits of using Docker?
- Lightweight and portable
- Fast deployments
- Isolated environments

## 22. What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container?
- **Image:** Blueprint of the container.
- **Container:** Running instance of an image.

## 23. How do you manage persistent storage in Docker?
Use **Volumes** (`docker volume create mydata`).

## 24. What is Kubernetes, and how does it help with container orchestration?
Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## 25. What is the difference between Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet in Kubernetes?
- **Deployment:** Stateless applications.
- **StatefulSet:** Stateful applications (databases).
- **DaemonSet:** Runs one pod per node.

## 26. What are Kubernetes namespaces, and why are they used?
Namespaces isolate resources within a cluster.

## 27. Explain the role of Kubernetes Ingress.
Ingress manages external access to services.

## 28. What are Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets?
- **ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive config data.
- **Secrets:** Store sensitive data (base64 encoded).

# Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

## 29. What is Terraform, and how does it differ from CloudFormation?
Terraform is a cloud-agnostic IaC tool, while CloudFormation is AWS-specific.

## 30. What are Terraform modules, and why should you use them?
Modules reuse code for better organization.

## 31. How do you handle state management in Terraform?
Store state files in remote backends (e.g., S3, Consul).

## 32. What is the difference between `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`?
- **`plan`:** Shows changes before applying.
- **`apply`:** Executes the changes.

## 33. How do you use Terraform with multiple environments?
Use workspaces or separate state files.

# Security & Compliance in DevOps

## 44. How do you integrate security into a DevOps pipeline (DevSecOps)?
- Static code analysis
- Dependency scanning
- Automated security testing

## 45. What is Shift Left security?
Integrating security earlier in the development lifecycle.

## 46. What tools do you use for security scanning in DevOps?
- **Snyk**
- **SonarQube**
- **Trivy** (Docker security)
