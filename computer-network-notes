# 💻 Computer Networking Basics

## 1. 🌐 What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, switches, etc.) that communicate with each other using standard protocols.

## 2. 📡 Types of Networks
Networks can be classified based on their size and purpose:

- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Covers a small area like a home, office, or building.  
    *Example:* 🏠 Wi-Fi at home.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Covers a large geographic area.  
    *Example:* 🌍 The Internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – Covers a city or large campus. 🏙️
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)** – Small network for personal devices like Bluetooth connections. 📱
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** – Securely connects remote users over the internet. 🔒

## 3. 🖧 Networking Devices
Different hardware devices help in building a network:

- **Router** – Connects different networks and directs data. 🚦
- **Switch** – Connects devices within a LAN and manages data transfer. 🔀
- **Hub** – A basic device that simply forwards data to all connected devices. ⚙️
- **Modem** – Converts signals from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to a format usable by computers. 📡
- **Access Point** – Extends Wi-Fi signals within a network. 📶

## 4. 📜 Network Protocols
Protocols define how devices communicate over a network:

- **IP (Internet Protocol)** – Assigns unique addresses to devices. 🏷️
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – Ensures reliable data delivery. ✅
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – Sends data quickly but without guaranteed delivery. ⚡
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Used for web browsing. 🌐
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** – Transfers files between devices. 📂
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses. 🔗

## 5. 🧭 IP Addressing
Devices on a network are identified using IP addresses:

- **IPv4** (e.g., 192.168.1.1) – Most common format (limited addresses). 🔢
- **IPv6** (e.g., 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329) – Newer format with more addresses. 🔢

There are also public and private IPs:

- **Public IP** – Assigned by ISP and used to access the internet. 🌍
- **Private IP** – Used within a local network (e.g., 192.168.x.x). 🏠

## 6. 🖥️ Network Topologies (Structure of a Network)
- **Star** – All devices connect to a central switch/router. ⭐
- **Bus** – Devices share a single communication line. 🚌
- **Ring** – Devices are connected in a circular path. 🔄
- **Mesh** – Each device is connected to multiple devices for redundancy. 🕸️

## 7. 🗂️ OSI Model (How Data Moves in a Network)
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model explains how networking works in 7 layers:

1. **Physical Layer** – Deals with physical hardware like cables and Wi-Fi signals. 🔌
2. **Data Link Layer** – Manages data frames and MAC addresses. 🏷️
3. **Network Layer** – Handles IP addressing and routing. 🛣️
4. **Transport Layer** – Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP). 🚚
5. **Session Layer** – Manages connections between applications. 🔗
6. **Presentation Layer** – Formats and encrypts data. 🔐
7. **Application Layer** – Where user applications like browsers operate. 🌐

## 8. 🛠️ Basic Network Commands
- `ping` – Checks if a device is reachable. 📶
- `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` – Shows IP configuration. 🖥️
- `tracert` / `traceroute` – Displays the path packets take to a destination. 🛤️
- `nslookup` – Finds the IP address of a domain. 🔍
- `netstat` – Displays active network connections. 📡

## 9. 🔗 Wireless and Wired Networks
- **Wired Networks** – Use Ethernet cables (faster and more secure). 🔌
- **Wireless Networks** – Use Wi-Fi (more convenient, but can be less secure). 📶

## 10. 🔒 Network Security Basics
- **Firewalls** – Block unauthorized access. 🚧
- **Encryption** – Protects data from being intercepted. 🔐
- **VPN** – Encrypts internet traffic. 🛡️
- **MAC Filtering** – Limits network access to specific devices. 🖥️

### ❓ Questions and Answers:

#### Q1: What are the key differences between IPv4 and IPv6, and why is IPv6 becoming more important in modern networking?
**A:**  
- **IPv4** uses 32-bit addresses, allowing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, while **IPv6** uses 128-bit addresses, providing a virtually unlimited number of addresses.  
- IPv6 is becoming more important due to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and the growing number of internet-connected devices. 🌐

#### Q2: What is the purpose of the OSI Model in networking?  
**A:**  
The OSI Model provides a standardized framework for understanding and designing network communication. It divides networking into 7 layers, each with specific functions, to ensure interoperability between different systems and technologies. 🗂️

#### Q3: How does a router differ from a switch in a network?  
**A:**  
- A **router** connects different networks and directs data between them. 🚦  
- A **switch** connects devices within the same network (LAN) and manages data transfer between them. 🔀

#### Q4: What is the role of DNS in networking?  
**A:**  
DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. 🔗

#### Q5: Why is network security important, and what are some basic measures to secure a network?  
**A:**  
Network security is crucial to protect data and systems from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. Basic measures include using firewalls, encryption, VPNs, and MAC filtering. 🔒

#### Q6: What is the difference between a public IP and a private IP?  
**A:**  
- A **public IP** is assigned by an ISP and is used to access the internet. 🌍  
- A **private IP** is used within a local network and cannot be accessed directly from the internet. 🏠

#### Q7: What are the advantages of using a mesh topology in a network?  
**A:**  
Mesh topology provides redundancy and reliability, as each device is connected to multiple devices. This ensures that if one connection fails, data can still be transmitted through alternative paths. 🕸️
